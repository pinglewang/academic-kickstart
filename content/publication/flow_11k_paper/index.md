# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper examines how investors allocate their savings with a limited choice set. Using a hand-collected data set on firm-level investment decisions in 401(k) plans, we show that investors blindly follow unadjusted returns rather the CAPM alpha or Morningstar rating when investing in mutual funds. Our result informs recent debates on the drivers of fund flow. To explain the differences in results between ours and prior literature, we propose an explanation through the wealth inequality channel. We show that 14% of the population with high wages and financial market participation rates hold 51% of the wealth and direct their savings based on the CAPM alpha, whereas the remaining 86% of the population chase unadjusted returns. Our results serve as a wake-up call to the lack of financial literacy in 401(k) markets."
