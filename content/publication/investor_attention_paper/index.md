# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper studies the information acquisition process by investors using a novel dataset that tracks filing downloads on the SEC's EDGAR. Demand for 10-K filings predicts short-term positive return spread, and demand for 8-K filings predicts long-term negative return spread. The striking difference in the effects of 10-K and 8-K attention on stock prices can be contributed to the different viewing patterns. Demand for 10-K filings represents a general demand for assets, where 10-K visitors are typically infrequent visitors who never download any filings of the firm in past quarters. The effects are higher for attention-grabbing stocks. In the meanwhile, the demand for 8-K filings comes from frequent and local viewers with a potential information advantage. Such attention reduces information asymmetry of the firm, which decreases the cost of capital and explains the persistent underperformance of high 8-K attention stocks. "
