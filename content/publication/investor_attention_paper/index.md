# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper empirically shows that information acquisition affects stock returns by reducing information asymmetry of the firm. When firms disclose material information that was known by insiders, demand for information transforms private information into public information, drives up the contemporaneous price, and predicts persistent and negative abnormal returns. The supply of information has no direct effect on information asymmetry, but acts as a catalyst, through which the demand for information magnifies its effect. Moreover, demand for information has stronger effects when investors are geographically close to firm headquarters or have experience in collecting information, suggesting that the cost of information acquisition affects information asymmetry."
